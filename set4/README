To compile:
- switch to this directory
- type 'make'
An executable 'oglRenderer' should appear

To run, type:
./oglRenderer n xRes yRes < iv-file

Where n determines what shading mode to use:
0 = wireframe
1 = flat
2 = smooth
and xRes, yRes are the x and y resolutions of the final image.

All the iv files are kept in /data.

Actual example, for future reference:
./oglRenderer 0 800 800 < data/sphere.iv
