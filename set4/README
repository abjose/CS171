To compile:
- switch to this directory
- type 'make'
An executable 'oglRenderer' should appear

To run, type:
./oglRenderer n xRes yRes < iv-file

Where n determines what shading mode to use:
0 = wireframe
1 = flat
2 = smooth
and xRes, yRes are the x and y resolutions of the final image.

All the iv files are kept in /data.

Actual example, for future reference:
./oglRenderer 0 800 800 < data/sphere.iv


EXTRA CREDIT:
Lineset
Note: Currently, using the Lineset feature (i.e. if the .iv file has
_any_ LineSet commands in it) switches to a completely different redraw loop.
So, LineSet and normal rendering are mutually exclusive for now.
.iv files using LineSet can be found in data/ as usual.
