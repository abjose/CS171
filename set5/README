To compile:
- change to this directory
- type 'make'
An executable 'editSpline' should appear

To run:
type './editSpline [spline-file]' in the terminal

The optional spline-file parameter can be used to specify a file to read and/or
save spline data to. If the file does not exist, it will be made. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: data will only be saved properly if you use the keyboard to quit
(i.e. escape, 'q', or 'Q') rather than stopping the program some other way
like ctrl-c.


INTERFACE
