To compile:
- change to this directory
- type 'make'
An executable 'editSpline' should appear

To run:
type './editSpline [spline-file]' in the terminal

The optional spline-file parameter can be used to specify a file to read and/or
save spline data to. If the file does not exist, it will be made. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: data will only be saved properly if you use the keyboard to quit
(i.e. escape, 'q', or 'Q') rather than stopping the program some other way
like ctrl-c.


INTERFACE
==========
-left click + drag to move control points around
-right click to insert new control points
-shift + right click to delete the nearest control point (won't delete all)
-middle click to increase the nearest point's weight
-shift + middle click to decrease the nearest point's weight
-'t' to toggle control points/lines
-'q', 'Q', or esc to (optionally save and) quit

Notes
========
- Ctrl point deletion wasn't implemented quite like recommended in the set. I
  basically just remove the ctrl point and the nearest knot, and hope for the
  best. It seems to work alright, hopefully this is o.k
- Honestly not sure if changing the W value is having the intended effect. Seems
  sorta weird, particularly for negative values.
