This is code for set 2 of CS171.

To compile:
- change to this directory
- type 'make'
An executable 'wireframe' should appear

To run, type something like:
'./wireframe xRes yRes < filename | display -'
The two integers xRes and yRes indicate the size of the image to be made.
Filename is a .iv file as specified in the set - examples can be found in data/

For example,
'./wireframe 400 400 < data/lion2.iv | display -'
will show the lion2 example in a 400x400 window.
