raster.h and raster.cpp
Bill Clark

This program is intended to simplify rasterizing triangles.  Vertices
are defined as arbitrarily-lengthed arrays of floats.  Whatever data
is included at each vertex is interpolated across the triangle, and
each pixel gets the interpolated values passed to it, via a drawPixel
function.

This code should be self-explanatory, as I include voluminous comments
in both files.  Read raster.h for instructions.
