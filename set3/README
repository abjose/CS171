To compile:
- switch to this directory
- type 'make'
An executable 'shaded' should appear

To run, type:
./shaded n xRes yRes [-eyelight] < iv-file

Where n determines what shading mode to use:
0 = Flat
1 = Gouraud
2 = Phong
and xRes, yRes are the x and y resolutions of the final image.
An optional fourth parameter '-eyelight' can be added to create a bright green
light at the location of the camera.

To display the output, try something like:
shaded n xRes yRes < iv-file | display -

All the iv files are kept in /data.

Actual example, for future reference:
./shaded 0 800 800 < data/sphere.iv | display -
