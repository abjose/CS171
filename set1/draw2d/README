To compile:
- change to this directory
- type 'make'
An executable 'draw2d' should appear

To run, type:
'./draw2d xmin xmax ymin ymax xRes yRes < filename'
where xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax are max dimensions for the canvas
xRes and yRes are the dimensions of the final output.
And filename is a file as specified in the set.

You can display the output by doing something like:
'./draw2d xmin xmax ymin ymax xRes yRes < filename | display -'

For example:
'./draw2d -2 2 -2 2 400 400 < data/binaryclock.2d | display -'
Should display the binary clock example as a 400x400 image.
